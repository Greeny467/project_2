## Usage

Messaging on a normal messaging app or through text can get a little boring. I want a fun new way to exchange messages with my friends and family. Using Terse, I can send and receive messages but they are only allowed to be one word. It is fun to choose a word that is unique or descriptive of how I'm feeling or how my day is going.
